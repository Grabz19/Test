	<p>You regain consciousness as you hear the buzzing sound of a familiar alarm clock.

	<p>It's 6:00 AM.

	<p>You reach your hand out towards the desk to your right to shut off the alarm. Light illuminates the room as you flick the switch on the bedroom lamp. As you stand up, a cold shiver goes down your spine. You feel uneasy yet relieved. You can't explain the feeling.

	<p>You can't help but notice the lamp is shining more dimly than usual.

	<p>You walk up to the window to your left and peek through the curtain. It's pitch black outside.

	<p>As you look, you spot an unfamiliar reflection in the window. You turn around quickly. There is a note on your closet. It reads "7RC9". The letters are inscribed with crayons, and the handwriting looks as if it was written by a child. You decide to keep the note.</p>

	<p data-showif-arg-id="0">You decide to look around for clues. At quick glance, there does not appear to be anything particularly unusual about your bedroom. You're not exactly sure what you're even looking for.</p>
	<p>Out of sheer curiosity, you decide to look under the bed. You walk up to it and lay on your side, pressing your head against the floor. You hesitate for a second, reassuring yourself that tales about monsters under the bed are just fiction. You pull up the sheets.

	<p>Nothing.

	<p>You stand up.</p>

<div data-page="3">
	<p>"Who put this here?" - you think to yourself.

	<p>Several moments of confusion later. "Oh! It must have been that kid Jeremy- of the neighbors that live just outside the street. He always pulls random pranks on me when I wake up to go to work." - you speak loudly to yourself with great confidence.
	
	<p>"I'm sure he's hiding in this closet. Let us see who's the clever one this time, right Jeremy? You're not escaping me this time." - you add.
	
	<p>You grab the handle and start slowly pulling it towards you. A gasp of old air escapes the closet. Suddenly...
	
	<p>Nothing unusual whatsoever. Just your regular old clothes. Buzzkill.</p>

	<p>You're starting to feel pretty ill. You decide it would be better to skip work today and just go back to bed. You pull out your cellphone and start dialing Zach - your boss.
	
	<p>... ... ... "This is Zach. If you're hearing this message it means I'm busy and can't pick up the phone right now. Leave a message after the beep.". *beep*
	
	<p>You cancel the call. "Odd" - you think to yourself - "It's very unusual for my boss not to pick up the phone. Let's try again.".
	
	<p>... ... ... "This is Zach. If you're hearing this message it means I'm busy and can't pick up the phone right now. Leave a message after the beep.". *beep*
	
	<p>"Ah screw it" - you think in your head - "I'll just leave him a message that I'm not coming to work today.". You start speaking - "Hi boss, it's me, John. I'm feeling sick and I can't come to work today. I'm leaving you a message because you didn't pick up the phone.".
	
	<p>With that done, you decide to go back to bed.</p>

	<p data-showif-arg-notvisited="3">You feel like you should check outside the window again.</p>
	
	<p>You have a peek out the window.</p>
	
	<p>Still complete darkness. You have a look at the clock again - it now reads 6:05 AM.</p>
	
	<p>"Man... I know it's still early but... is it usually this dark at six?</p>
	
	<p data-showif-arg-visited="3">There is no sign of Jeremy. The darkness makes it impossible to see, anyway.</p>

	<p>You begin making an effort to climb out of the window. You slide open the curtains and twist the handle. The window opens up easily.
	
	<p>You live on the first floor, so jumping out shouldn't harm you in any way. However, as you look out, you notice that you can't see the ground below your apartment.
	
	<p>This alarms you at first, but you remember that it's simply dark outside. You quickly consider whether your stunt is actually worth your time.</p>

	<p>After a brief period of thought you've come back to your senses.

	<p>You reach your hand towards the door handle and try to open the door.
	
	<p>The door doesn't budge.
	
	<p>A quick surge of anxiety goes over you. "Why is the door closed? I never lock my bedroom door. What happened? Is this a joke?<span data-showif-arg-visited="3"> Jeremy, if you're still here, this is not a joke.</span>"</p>
	
	<p>"Keys, that's right." - you say as you calm down - "My keys should be here somewhere. I must have locked the door by accident yesterday"

	<p>Darkness.
	
	<p>What's happening?
	
	<p>Darkness.
	
	<p data-showif-arg-visited="7">You jump back from the closet and fall right through the open window.
	
	<p data-showif-arg-notvisited="7">You jump back from the closet and hit the window opposite of it. You look around. "Did the lamp break? Am I crazy?". You see nothing. Soon, you feel nothing.

	<p>The lamp barely gives out any light. "Weird" - you think - "The light seemed fine yesterday. Hang on a minute! Has all this not happened just now?".
	
	<p>"I must have been dreaming... it felt so real though." - you wonder.

	<p>Your eyes shift towards the closet. The note is not there.</p>
